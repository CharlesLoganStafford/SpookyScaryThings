# SpookyScaryThings

https://loganator456.github.io/SpookyScaryThings/

A JavaScript webpage testing game engine, physics, animations, and sounds. On my page, fifteen (15) spooky, scary ghosts spawn at random points on the background and then are allowed to freefall and bounce off each other over some creepy music and some rather loud "bump" effects.

This is a small web-based project inspired by an assignment from a course I took at UWT and several YouTube videos. I made this casually over the course of about a week and have been slowly organizing and cleaning up the code for presentation and reusability ever since.

The project itself consists primarily of a JavaScript game engine originally made by Seth Ladd and edited by Christopher Marriott (a former intructor of mine) and a small amount of HTML and CSS which allow the page to be hosted online and look halfway decent. The game engine as I begin with only had a basic timer, asset manager, basic animations, and an abstract "entity" class which could serve as a basic template for in-game entites. The sprites, sounds, and background image were all found online and were picked primarily just to contribute to the creepy theme (I love horror and spooky things) rather than fit any other particular niche, so they aren't related or matching in any other particular aspect.

This was my first foray into learning JavaScript (coming from a Java and C background), and trying to deal with accuracy and code cleanliness was quite a learning experience since I was not used to dealing with the types of mistakes that can occur when using a weakly-typed language. While it's interesting and quite convient to not have to deal with type errors and just code, I spent a few extra hours of very vague debugging time on this project that I could have otherwise avoided.

A lot of the physics logic came from an excellent Javascript tutorial that can be found on YouTube created by ChrisCourses, which is an excellent resource for novice programmers. The credits for the pages resources can be found on the page itself. If you stumbled upon this project of mine and are new to coding, I've found in my experience that his tutorials have been very helpful in the past as a smaller, supplemental addition to my education in CS.

** Please note that I consider this a "pet project" of mine and may continually edit the code for the sake of efficiency and minimalism, but overall functionally should not change. **

Thanks!
